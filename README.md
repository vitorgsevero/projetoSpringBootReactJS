# Kanban Board: a Project Management Tool built with Spring Boot 2.0, ReactJS and Redux

Full Stack Project: Spring Boot 2.0, ReactJS, Redux and Bootstrap 4+

### These are some of the cool things I have worked on this repository:

* Built my REST APIs with Spring Boot 2.0 for CRUD operations

* Created the front-end using ReactJS and Bootstrap 4+

* Consume a RESTful API with ReactJS/Redux

* Redux and Thunk to manage the state of the application in the front-end

* Application security using JWT tokens

* Deploy application to Heroku


#### Here is the link of the application on Heroku:
